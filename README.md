# Airline-Reservation-project

Airline Reservation System
This project is a mini Airline Reservation System built using MySQL. It allows management of flights, customers, seat bookings, and cancellations through a structured database with triggers, views, and stored procedures.

Project Structure
The system contains the following modules:

Flights: Store details of all flights

Customers: Store customer/passenger information

Bookings: Record flight bookings by customers

Seats: Track seat availability for each flight

Key Features
Flight Search: Search available flights by source, destination, or date.

Booking System: Book available seats with automatic updates.

Seat Management: View available and booked seats.

Triggers: Automatically update seat counts on booking or cancellation.

Views: Predefined views for quick access to available flight details.

Reports: Generate customer-wise booking reports.

How to Run the Project
Open MySQL Workbench

Create a new SQL schema named AirlineDB

Run the full SQL script in this order:

Create tables and constraints

Insert sample data

Create views, triggers, and stored procedures

Use SELECT, CALL, and other queries to test functionality.


Deliverables
SQL file containing:
Table schemas with constraints
Sample data for flights, bookings, and customers
Triggers and views for seat updates and availability
Stored procedures for booking logic
README for setup and usage instructions (this file)

Skills Demonstrated
Database design and normalization
Query optimization and joins
Use of views, triggers, procedures
Real-world logic implementation in SQL
